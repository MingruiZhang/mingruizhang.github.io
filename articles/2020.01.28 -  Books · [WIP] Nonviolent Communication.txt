NVC的读后感，总结下每一章的内容，写出重点，最后总结对自己的要求

<i>1. Giving From the Heart</i>

NVC: a way of communicating that leads us to give from the heart.
We perceive relationships in a new light when we use NVC to hear our own deeper needs and those of others.
Four components of NVC: 1. observations 2. feelings 3. needs 4.requests.
Two part if NVC: 1. express honestly through the four components. 2. receive empathically through the four components.

NVC的核心理念是沟通应该focus on 人的feelings and needs。世界上所有人的feel 和 needs是共同的。如此沟通能解决所有障碍。
NVC四要素1. observations 2. feelings 3. needs 4.requests。在自我表达的时候honest表达四要素，聆听别人的时候利用empathy发现别人的feelings and needs.

<i>2. Communication That Blocks Compassion</i>

Certain ways of communicating alienate us from natural state of compassion.
In the words of judgments, our concern centers on "who is what".
Analyses of others are actually expressions of our own needs and values.
Classifying and judging people promotes violence.
Comparisons are a form of judgment.
Our language obscures awareness of personal responsibility.
We can replace languages that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice.
We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsibility for how we behave, think and feel.
We can never make people do anything.
Thinking based on "who deserves what" blocks compassionate communication.
Life-alienating communication has deep philosophical and political roots.

沟通时候杜绝做judgment，不做比较，才可以有compassion.

<i>3. Observing Without Evaluating</i>

When we combine observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear criticism.

observe的时候做到客观，不做分析

<i>4. Identifying and Expressing Feelings</i>

Expressing our vulnerability can help resolve conflicts.
Distinguish feelings from thoughts.
Distinguish between what we feel and what we think we are.
Distinguish between what we feel and how we think others react or behave towards us.

挖掘真是内在的感受，不带任何思考，不受别人影响

<i>5. Taking Responsibility for Our Feelings</i>

What others do may be the stimulus of our feelings, but not the cause.
Four options for receiving negative messages: 1. blame ourselves. 2 blame others. 3. sense our own feelings and needs. 4. sense others' feelings and needs.
Connect your feeling with your needs: "I feel ... because I need ...".
Distinguish between giving from the heart and being motivated by guilt.
Judgments of others are alienated expressions of our own unmet needs.
If we express our needs, we have a better chance of getting them met.
If we don't value our needs, others mat not either.

感受是自己的，别人可能刺激，但是不会产生你的感受。从自己的感受出发发觉自己的需求，不要从愧疚中。不对别人做judgments或者criticism，重视自己的感受（或者别人的）。

<i>6. Requesting That Which Would Enrich Life</i>

Use positive language when making request.
Making requests in clear, positive, concrete action language reveals what we really want.
Vague language contributes to internal confusion.
Depression is the reward we get for being "good".
Request might sounds like demand when unaccompanied by the speaker's feeling and needs.
To make sure the message we sent is the message that's received, ask the listener to reflect it back.
After we express ourselves vulnerably, we often want to know 1) what the listener is feeling, 2) what the listener is thinking. 3) whether the listener would be willing to take a particular action.
In a group, much time is wasted when speakers aren't certain what response they're wanting.
Demand vs Request: demand can be only submitted or rebelled.
Our objective is a relationship based on honesty and empathy.

needs之后是一个明确的request，一定要明确避免一切模糊。最好让listener重复一遍。在给一个group communicate的时候一定要明确我们想到得到什么。request不是demand，不是只有做或者不做，不做批判或者judge，不造成guilt，如果对方不同意，用empathy去理解对方对方的needs.
