一周的时间读完了The hard thing about hard things，作者Ben Horowitz现在是Andreessen Horowitz VC的创始人，之前他和Marc Andreessen创业建立过LundCloud, Opsware 等公司。Opsware最后被HP以1.65B$收购。

本书可以说是他讲述CEO的一些经验，可能遇到的一些问题，以及解决方法。

如果我是一个CEO，我正在创业，这本书可以对我更有作用一些。但是即使设想自己是一个Manager，或者以此思考与理解High Level，也是有一点收获的吧。内容有一些松散，这次读后感也还是按照章节标题拆写想法吧。

<i>1. From communist to venture capitalist</i>

这一章讲述了Ben Horowitz创业前经历，从童年的事情，认识妻子，到起初工作的经历。比较有意思的是Ben加入Netscape的时候27岁，29岁的时候就已经有三个孩子了，32岁创业做LundCloud。

<i>2. "I will survive"</i>

LundCloud的创业经历，如何快速增长到500人，然后经历了2000年的dotcom crash之后如何在生死边缘摸索，最后强行上市自救。最后拆除Opsware software成为了新公司，Lundcloud卖给了EDS (16.5M$)。

<q>If you are going to eat shit, don't nibble
  What would you do if we went bankrupt
  Past the deadline is better than not having one
</q>

<i>3. This time with feeling</i>

讲Opsware创业的故事，如何从一开始市场极其看衰（60M$ 现金 + 20M$ Yearly income from EDS，却估值30M$)。团结所有人，遇到EDS危机60天保住了90%的营收，为此收购了Telegram, 为其原来CTO支付cancer治疗费（并不需要）。之后快速增长，最后1.65被HP收购。

<q>Whenever a large organization attempts to do anything, it always comes down to a single person who can delay the entire project
  We have one bullet left in the gun and we must hit the target.
  It was a great experience for them to be thrown into the middle of the ocean and told, "okay, swim"
  Figure out the right product is the innovator's job, not the customer's job. The customer only knows what she thinks she wants based on her experience with the current product.
  Conventional wisdom had nothing to do with the truth and the efficient market hypothesis was deceptive.
  It's a good question to ask, "What am I not doing".

<i>4. When things fall apart</i>

  The struggle
  CEOs should tell it like it is
  The right way to lay people off
  Preparing to fire an executive
  Demoting a loyal friend
  Lies that losers tell
  Lead bullets
  Nobody cares

<q>The ability to focus and make the best move when there are no good moves
  It's the moment where you fell most like hiding or dying that ou can make the biggest difference as a CEO.
  Keep death in mind at all times.
  Don't be optimistic.
  Humans particularly those who build things, only listen to the leading indicators of good news.
  When things go wrong in your company, nobody cares.

<i>5. Take care of the people, the products, and the profits: in that order :</i>

  A good place to work
  Why startups should train their people

  Why it's hard to bring big company execs into little companies
  Hiring executives: if you've never done the job, how do you hire somebody good?
  When employees misinterpret managers
  Management debt
  Management quality assurance

<q>Hire for strength, not lack of weakness
  Job of a big company executive is very different from the job of a small company executive.
  The very best way to know what you want is to act in the role. Not just in title, but in real action.

  How to minimize politics in your company
  The right kind of ambition
  Titles and promotions

  The scale anticipation fallacy

<q>Sometimes an organization doesn't need solution; it just needs clarity

  Law of Crappy People: For any title level in a large organization, the talent on that level will eventually converge to the crappiest person with the title.
  If you like structured agendas, then the employee should set the agenda.
