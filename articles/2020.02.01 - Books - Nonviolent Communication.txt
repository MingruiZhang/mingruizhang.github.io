<strong>-- 每章摘要 --</strong>

<i>1. Giving From the Heart</i>

<q>NVC: a way of communicating that leads us to give from the heart.
  We perceive relationships in a new light when we use NVC to hear our own deeper needs and those of others.
  Four components of NVC: 1. observations 2. feelings 3. needs 4.requests.
  Two part if NVC: 1. express honestly through the four components. 2. receive empathically through the four
  components.</q>
NVC的核心理念是沟通应该focus on 人的feelings and needs。世界上所有人的feel 和 needs是共同的。如此沟通能解决所有障碍。
NVC四要素1. observations 2. feelings 3. needs 4.requests。在自我表达的时候honest表达四要素，聆听别人的时候利用empathy发现别人的feelings and needs.

<i>2. Communication That Blocks Compassion</i>

<q>Certain ways of communicating alienate us from natural state of compassion.
  In the words of judgments, our concern centers on "who is what".
  Analyses of others are actually expressions of our own needs and values.
  Classifying and judging people promotes violence.
  Comparisons are a form of judgment.
  Our language obscures awareness of personal responsibility.
  We can replace languages that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice.
  We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsibility for how we behave, think and feel.
  We can never make people do anything.
  Thinking based on "who deserves what" blocks compassionate communication.
  Life-alienating communication has deep philosophical and political roots.</q>
沟通时候杜绝做judgment，不做比较，才可以有compassion.

<i>3. Observing Without Evaluating</i>

<q>When we combine observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear criticism.</q>
observe的时候做到客观，不做分析

<i>4. Identifying and Expressing Feelings</i>

<q>Expressing our vulnerability can help resolve conflicts.
  Distinguish feelings from thoughts.
  Distinguish between what we feel and what we think we are.
  Distinguish between what we feel and how we think others react or behave towards us.</q>
挖掘真是内在的感受，不带任何思考，不受别人影响

<i>5. Taking Responsibility for Our Feelings</i>

<q>What others do may be the stimulus of our feelings, but not the cause.
  Four options for receiving negative messages: 1. blame ourselves. 2 blame others. 3. sense our own feelings and needs.
  4. sense others' feelings and needs.
  Connect your feeling with your needs: "I feel ... because I need ...".
  Distinguish between giving from the heart and being motivated by guilt.
  Judgments of others are alienated expressions of our own unmet needs.
  If we express our needs, we have a better chance of getting them met.
  If we don't value our needs, others mat not either.</q>
感受是自己的，别人可能刺激，但是不会产生你的感受。从自己的感受出发发觉自己的需求，不要从愧疚中。不对别人做judgments或者criticism，重视自己的感受（或者别人的）。

<i>6. Requesting That Which Would Enrich Life</i>

<q>Use positive language when making request.
  Making requests in clear, positive, concrete action language reveals what we really want.
  Vague language contributes to internal confusion.
  Depression is the reward we get for being "good".
  Request might sounds like demand when unaccompanied by the speaker's feeling and needs.
  To make sure the message we sent is the message that's received, ask the listener to reflect it back.
  After we express ourselves vulnerably, we often want to know 1) what the listener is feeling, 2) what the listener is
  thinking. 3) whether the listener would be willing to take a particular action.
  In a group, much time is wasted when speakers aren't certain what response they're wanting.
  Demand vs Request: demand can be only submitted or rebelled.
  Our objective is a relationship based on honesty and empathy.
</q>
了解Needs之后是一个明确的request，一定要明确避免一切模糊。最好让listener重复一遍。在给一个group
communicate的时候一定要明确我们想到得到什么。request不是demand，不是只有做或者不做，不做批判或者judge，不造成guilt，如果对方不同意，用empathy去理解对方对方的needs.

<i>7. Receiving Empathically</i>

<q>Empty our mind and listening with our whole being.
  Ask before offering advice or reassurance.
  Intellectual understanding blocks empathy.
  Listen to what people are needing rather than what they are thinking.
  When ask for information, first express our own feelings and needs.
  Paraphrase only when it contributes to greater compassion and understanding.
  Paraphrasing saves time.
</q>
作为听着，不要着急去说自己的建议或者想法，挖掘倾诉者的feelings and needs，只听。给建议之前先询问。

<i>8. The Power of Empathy</i>

<q>"Don't just do something..."
  It's harder to empathize with those who appear to possess more power, status or resources.
  The more empathize with the other party, the safer we feel.
  Rather than put your "but" in the face of an angry person, empathize.
  It may be difficult to empathize with those who are closest to us.
  That bores the listener bores the speaker as well.
  Speakers prefer that listeners interrupt rather than pretend to listen.
  Empathize with silence by listening for the feelings and needs behind it.
</q>
如何更好地去Empathize？还是去抓住对方的感受，这对亲人和上级比较难一些。另外适当的interrupt去empathize对方的感受，甚至可以适当的沉默。

<i>9.Connecting Compassionately With Ourselves</i>

<q>NVC's most important use may be developing self-compassion
  We use NVC to evaluate ourselves in ways that engender growth rather than self-hatred.
  Avoid shoulding yourself!
  Self-judgments, like all judgments, are tragic expressions of unmet needs.
  NVC mourning: connecting with the feelings and unmet needs stimulated by past actions we now regret.
  NVC self-forgiveness: connecting with the need we were trying to meet when we took the action that we now regret.
  We are compassionate with ourselves when we are able to embrace all parts of ourselves and recognize the needs and
  values expressed by each part.
  We want to take action out of the desire to contribute to life rather than out of fear, guilt, shame, or obligation.
  With every choice you make, be conscious of what need it serves.
  Be conscious of actions motivated by the desire for money or approval, and by fear, shame, or guilt. Know the price
  you pay for them.
  The most dangerous of all behaviors may consist of doing things "because we're supposed to".
</q>
本书最重要（自认为）是对自己使用NVC，要永远明白自己的做的事情在serve自己的什么need。
不要因为fear, guilt, shame, or obligation做事情，如果做了，也要明白这里面的代价。
不要说自己”应该“做什么，应该是外部施加的，而应该从自己的内在需求，说”需要“什么所以要做什么。
如果regret做了什么事情，去思考当时有什么need没有被满足，或者我们当时在尝试满足什么need，而是行为不对。

<i>10.Expressing Anger Fully</i>

<q>Hurting people is superficial.
  We are never angry because of what others say or do.
  To motivate by guilt, mix up stimulus and cause.
  The cause of anger lies in our thinking - in thoughts of blame and judgment.
  When we judge others, we contribute to violence.
  Use anger as a wake-up call.
  When we become aware of our needs, anger gives away to life-serving feelings.
  Violence comes from the belief that other people cause our pain and therefore deserve punishment.
  Judgments of others contributes to self-fulfilling prophecies.
  Steps to expressing anger: 1. Stop.Breathe. 2. Identify our judgmental thoughts. 3. Connect with our needs. 4. Express
  our feelings and unmet needs.
  Stay conscious of the violent thoughts that arise in our minds, without judging them.
  Our need is for the other person to truly hear our pain.
  People do not hear your pain when they believe they are at fault.
  Take your time.
</q>
本书对我最重要的一章，如何处理Anger。
我们anger不是因为别人做了什么，而且是源自自己的needs。
因为anger去伤害别人是肤浅的，没办法帮助我们实现自己的need。
当生气的时候。1. 深呼吸 2. 把握生气时候的想法 3. 挖掘自己的需求是什么。4. 通过NVC表达自己的需求。
慢慢来。

<i>11. Conflict Resolution and Mediation</i>

<q>Creating a connection between people is the most important thing.
  When you make the connection, the problem usually solves itself.
  Avoid the use of language that implies wrongness.
  Learn to hear needs regardless of how people express them.
  Criticism and diagnosis get in the way of peaceful resolution of conflict.
  People often need empathy before they are able to hear what is being said.
  The objective is not to get the other parties to do what we want them to do.
  Role-play is simply putting ourselves in the other person's shoes.
</q>
处理conflict的时候最重要的是让双方可以交流彼此的needs。 当双方能听到对方的needs问题就自然会解决。如果有一方有太多pain我们就empathy，听到no不是rejection，是一个机会我们我需要进一步了解needs.

<i>12. The Protective Use of Force</i>

<q>The intention behind the protective use of force is only to protect, not to punish, blame or condemn.
  Fear of corporal punishment obscures children's awareness of the compassion underlying their parents' demands.
  When we fear punishment, we focus on consequences, not on our own values.
  Fear of punishment diminishes self-esteem and goodwill.
</q>

使用force的主要intention只能是protect，punish会产生敌意和抵触心理，即使可以实现你希望别人做什么的结果，但是别人的motivation还是很低，无法长期维持。

<i>13. Liberate Ourselves and Counseling Others</i>

<q>The ability to hear our own feelings and needs and empathize with them can free us from depression.
  Focus on what we want to do rather than what went wrong.
  Defuse stress by hearing our own feelings and needs.
  Defuse stress by empathizing with others.
  I empathized with clients instead of interpreting them; I reveled myself instead of diagnosing them.
</q>

NVC帮助inner communication，当我们有负面情绪的时候，把他们转换成feelings and needs然后去empathy. 发现自己深处的需求而不是怪罪自己或者别人.

<i>14. Expressing Appreciation in NVC</i>

<q>Compliments are often judgments - however positive-of others.
  Express appreciation to celebrate, not to manipulate.
  Saying "thank you" in NVC: "this is what you did; this is what I feel; this is the need of mine that was met."
  Receiving appreciation without feeling of superiority or false humility.
</q>
表达appreciation也会从NVC做起，表达对方做了什么，你的感受如何，你的什么need被fulfill了。不要试图通过appreciation去操控别人，长期无效。
